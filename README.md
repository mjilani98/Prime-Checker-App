*Overview

 -This is a simple Prime Number Checker App built using Java in Android Studio. The app allows users to input a number and determines whether it is a prime number. The user interface is built programmatically using Java without any XML layout files. The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, ensuring clean code organization.

*Features

 -User Input: EditText box with a hint to enter a number.

 -Result Display: TextView to display whether the entered number is prime or not.

 -Submit Button: Button to trigger the prime-checking logic.

 Modern UI Design:

  -Colors: Aesthetic color choices for a visually appealing interface.

  -Fonts & Spacing: Readable font sizes and properly spaced components.

  -RelativeLayout: Used to position elements dynamically.

*App Structure (MVC Architecture)

 -Model Class (PrimeModel.java): Handles the logic for checking if a number is prime.

 -Interface Class (AppInterface.java): Defines and organizes UI elements programmatically.

 -Controller/Main Class (MainActivity.java): Connects the UI with the model, handling user interactions.

*How It Works

 -The user enters a number in the input box.

 -The user clicks the "Submit" button.

 -The app checks whether the number is prime using the model class.

 -The result is displayed in the text view.
